# Ruby scripts for lazy XD
The scripts here are written for me lazy.
<br>

## Auto ab test>
This script support repeat ab test and calculate average.
<br>Basically use ab(apache benchmarking) binary

## Find Sql-injection>
This script find sql-injection and purpose in json formatted weblog(access.log).
<br>This script does not support the usual access.log. You can modify the script.
<br>Detection rules(regex) are based on SQLMAP
